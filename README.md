# FinDataRESTfulAPI
This is a stock market RESTful API that I developed using Python's bottle library &amp; MongoDB. This API allows the user to perform simple CRUD operations on a MongoDB database containing financial data. It also provides endpoints for the user to generate simple reports using the fiancial information stored in the database.
